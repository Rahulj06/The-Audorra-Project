# Analytics Setup Guide

## ðŸ“Š Analytics Implementation

Your site now has **two analytics systems**:

### 1. **Google Analytics 4** (Professional, Cross-Device)

#### Setup Steps:

1. **Create a Google Analytics Account**
   - Go to https://analytics.google.com/
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Click "Start measuring"
   - Create a new property for "The Audorra Project"

2. **Get Your Measurement ID**
   - In GA4, go to Admin â†’ Data Streams
   - Add a new Web stream
   - Enter your website URL
   - Copy your **Measurement ID** (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

3. **Update Your Site**
   - Open `index.html`
   - Replace **both instances** of `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID
   ```html
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-YOUR-ID-HERE"></script>
   ```
   and
   ```javascript
   gtag('config', 'G-YOUR-ID-HERE', {
   ```

4. **Verify It's Working**
   - Deploy your site
   - Visit it in a browser
   - Go to GA4 â†’ Reports â†’ Realtime
   - You should see your visit appear within seconds!

#### What Gets Tracked:
- âœ… **Page views** - Every time someone visits
- âœ… **Song plays** - When users click "Listen"
- âœ… **Song requests** - When users submit recommendations
- âœ… **Social clicks** - Instagram & YouTube button clicks
- âœ… **Collaborate clicks** - Email collaboration button
- âœ… **User demographics** - Location, device, browser (anonymous)
- âœ… **Traffic sources** - Where visitors came from

#### View Your Analytics:
Go to https://analytics.google.com/ and check:
- **Realtime** - Current active users
- **Reports â†’ Acquisition** - Where traffic comes from
- **Reports â†’ Engagement** - What users do on your site
- **Reports â†’ Events** - Custom events (song plays, requests, etc.)

---

### 2. **Local Visitor Counter** (Demo Widget)

A simple visual counter displayed on your homepage that shows:
- **Total Visits** - All-time visit count
- **Today** - Visits today
- **Unique** - Unique visitors (browser-based)

**Note**: This is stored in browser localStorage, so it's only visible to individual users. For real analytics, rely on Google Analytics.

#### Optional: Hide the Widget
If you want to hide the visitor stats widget, edit `src/App.vue`:
```vue
<!-- Comment out or remove this section -->
<!-- <section class="px-3 sm:px-4 md:px-8 lg:px-12 mt-6">
  <VisitorStats class="max-w-4xl mx-auto" />
</section> -->
```
